      <p><b>Skip to end to not be spoiled</b>

   
    <p><b> The movie starts with Spider-Gwen's dad captain Stacy doing whatever. This is where we start to learn about Her backstory. We learn how she is accused have killing her peter. This is great as a main focus of the movie is on gwen
      </b></p>;

    <p><b>
        Okay, well quick summary. Gwen gets caught by her father and she quickly leaves to this agency of Spider-people in a lot of universes. Their goal is to make sure that there isn't any distrubtion to "canon events". What canon events are is events that are supposed to happen. Then she goes into Miles universe to say hello and to stop the Spot. The Spot is the big bad, he got corrupted in the collinder during the first movie. He wants to kill Miles and to get the power he will universe hop to get more power, distrubing the timeline. Then both of them go to another universe to stop him. First, he got away, but Miles disturbed a canon event. This makes the agency angry. Then, Miles gets invited, after talking with the boss of the agnecy, Miguel O'Hara.

    <p><b>After Miles learns that a canon event is that Miles' father dies. He wnat to stop this. However, they argue that this has to happen or the universe gets deleted. Then, we learn that the spider that bit him was from another universe and that universe is not in a good shape because the spider left, meaning no spiderman. Then, they ahve a big fight after he gets teleported back "home". Turns out he got teleported to the universe where his spider was from. He enocunters their universe version of Miles is the prowler. Gwen gathers a team of spiders to save him. The movie ends on that cliff hanger. </b> </p>

        Like the orginal, Across the Spiderverse has a wonderful and creative art style. It has a wonderul story streight to the end. The cliff hanger at the was a very decent ending to the movie. Overall, a great story, decent ending and stellar visuals. It is a great movie. There isn't much bad about it the only issue is it felt as if it was forced. I felt as if the orginal did not have much more story to tell. However, they told it so well that it doesn't really matter to me.

      Overall, the movie is great with no much worng about it. Although this movie could have not existed and nothing will happen, as the first movie had far enough. This is a movie that happened and it happened great. The movie is amazing and I highly recomend watching it.
